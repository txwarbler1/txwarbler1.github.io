    <p>Located in Dallas, Texas, the temple was dedicated on October 19, 1984 by Gordon B. Hinckley. The temple sits on a 6-acre (24,000 m2) site and was originally 18,000 square feet (1,700 m2). It was the first temple in Texas and the South Central United States. With the LDS Church growing rapidly in the area, the temple was remodeled in 1987 to increase its size and make it more functional and efficient. The addition gave the temple 22,749 square feet (2,113 m2) of added space. The Dallas Texas Temple currently has a total floor area of 46,956 square feet (4,362 m2), five ordinance rooms, and four sealing rooms.</p>
    
    <h2>Blessings of the Temples</h2>
    <div class="news">
    <p>I think there is no place in the world where I feel closer to the Lord than in one of His holy temples. 
      To paraphrase a poem: How far is heaven?
      It’s not very far.
      In temples of God,
      It’s right where we are.
      The Lord said:
      “Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:
      “But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:
      “For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.”1
      To members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the temple is the most sacred place on earth. It is the house of the Lord, and just as the inscription on the exterior of the temple states, the temple is “holiness to the Lord.”
      </p>

    <p>In the temple, the precious plan of God is taught. It is in the temple that eternal covenants are made. The temple lifts us, exalts us, stands as a beacon for all to see, and points us toward celestial glory. It is the house of God. All that occurs within the walls of the temple is uplifting and ennobling.</p>

    <p>The temple is for families, one of the greatest treasures we have in mortality. The Lord has been very explicit in talking to us fathers, indicating that we have a responsibility to love our wives with all of our hearts and to provide for them and for our children. He has indicated that the greatest work we parents can do is performed in our homes, and our homes can be heaven, particularly when our marriages are sealed in the house of God.</p>

    <p>The late Elder Matthew Cowley, who was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, once recounted the Saturday afternoon experience of a grandfather as hand in hand he took his small granddaughter on a birthday visit—not to the zoo or to the movies but to the temple grounds. With permission of the groundskeeper, the two walked to the large doors of the temple. He suggested that she place her hand on the sturdy wall and then on the massive door. Tenderly he then said to her, “Remember that this day you touched the temple. One day you will go inside.” His gift to the little one was not candy or ice cream but an experience far more significant and everlasting—an appreciation of the house of the Lord. She had touched the temple, and the temple had touched her.</p>
